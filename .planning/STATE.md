# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-14)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build order is Deck Management -> Log Infrastructure -> Live Tracking -> Replay Viewer based on dependency analysis
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 (Log Infrastructure) has no UI; phases 1, 3, 4 have UI components
- [Roadmap]: Global hotkeys via wx.Frame.RegisterHotKey (not keyboard/pynput libraries)
- [Roadmap]: New services/ directory for LogWatcher, GameEngine, GlobalHotkeyService, ReplayEngine

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- LOG pitfalls to address in Phase 2: PowerTaskList duplication, file reset detection, threading stop/join, log.config management
- hslog and hsreplay are already installed as transitive dependencies (verify during Phase 2)
